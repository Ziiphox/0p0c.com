	So what is this?<br>
    <p>i guess i just want to do something cool maybe? a learning excercise is how i see it but mostly i think i just want to make some pretty colours through obscene abstraction. poetic.</p><br>
    You didn't answer the question<br>
    <p>oh. I want to (first) make a simple image classifier so i can then muck around with exploiting said network by generating images that stimulate a certain output without necssarilly looking like the item in question.</p><br>
    How will this work?
    <p>The image classifier will be pretty standard, probably 32x32 pixels or whatever i choose, plugged into the input layer yada yada something something hidden layers then to some arbitrary outputs for each item i feel like classifying, you know how it goes. the jucy part is exploiting the network's biases, where I'll then create a random image and see what the network thinks, then further optimize the image so the network thinks it's one certain output and none of the others. kind of like asking the network what it thinks the most [thing]-like thing possible would look like</p><br>
